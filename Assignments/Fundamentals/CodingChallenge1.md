## Prabin and Ram comparing their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
__*BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height)*__ 

(mass in kg and height in meter).

## Your tasks:
1. Store Prabin's and Ram's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula
3. Create a Boolean variable 'prabinHigherBMI' containing information about whether Prabin has a higher BMI than Ram.
4. You need to calculate BIM

## Test data:
1. 2022 Data:   Prabin weights 78 kg and is 1.70 m tall.
